<p>An ongoing collection scripts used in production work at the Brooklyn Museum.</p>

**Everything Metadata**
<p>Adds plaintext username, color used in doc, fonts used in doc, date, modification date, creation date, number of page.</p>

**Everything Ungroup**
<p> As the name suggested, this script ungroups everything in the document. Used primarly as a partner script to an <i>Outline Everything</i> script that outlines everything in document (including master pages) to prep for cut vinyl production. </p>
