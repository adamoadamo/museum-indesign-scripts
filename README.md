### Everything Metadata
Adds plaintext username, color used in doc, fonts used in doc, date, modification date, creation date, number of page.

### Everything Ungroup
As the name suggested, this script ungroups everything in the document. Used primarly as a partner script to an <i>Outline Everything</i> script that outlines everything in document (including master pages) to prep for cut vinyl production. 

### Everything Outlined
As the name suggested, this script outlines everything in the document including text on the parent pages. Used after applying the <i>Everything Ungroup</i>.
