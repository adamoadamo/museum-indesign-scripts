# Museum InDesign Scripts
An ongoing collection scripts used in graphic design production work at the Brooklyn Museum.</p>

### Everything Metadata
Adds plaintext username, color used in doc, fonts used in doc, date, modification date, creation date, number of page.

### Everything Outline
As the name suggested, this script ungroups everything in the document and master pages, outlines all of the text, then outlines all of the strokes.
