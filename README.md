# Museum InDesign Scripts
An ongoing collection scripts used in graphic design production work at the Brooklyn Museum.</p>

### Everything Outline
As the name suggested, this script ungroups everything in the document and master pages, outlines all of the text. Useful for prepping large documents for vinyl production.

### Export and add Dimensions
This script exports each page of the open document as a high-res PNG at 72 DPI and places the page dimensions at the end of file name ie: filename_100Ã—100px.png.
